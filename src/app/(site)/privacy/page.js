              <strong>Summary.</strong> We collect what a repair, pickup, sale or purchase genuinely
              requires — who you are, how to reach you, where to collect the device, what the device
              is and what is wrong with it. We share it with the one shop you choose. We keep it for
              as long as the service record needs to exist, and you can ask us to correct or delete
              it at any time.

              <p>
                {BRAND.name} is a platform built and operated by {BRAND.company} ({BRAND.website}).
                It has two sides: an app for customers who want a device repaired, collected, sold or
                bought, and an app for the mobile repair shops that provide those services. This
                policy is issued by {BRAND.company}, which is the controller of the personal
                information described here.
              </p>
              <p>
                Repair shops on {BRAND.name} are independent businesses. When you choose a shop, that
                shop becomes responsible for how it handles your device and the information it needs
                to service it. We provide the software both of you use.
              </p>
            </PolicySection>

            <PolicySection index={2} id={SECTIONS[1].id} title={SECTIONS[1].title}>
              <p>This policy applies to:</p>

                  <strong>{BRAND.customerAppName}</strong> — the customer app with Home, Repair,

                <li>

                <li>

                It does not cover what an individual repair shop does with information you give it

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Account details</strong> — your name, mobile number and email address. Shop
                  owners additionally provide shop name, shop address, business contact numbers and
                  the KYC documents required to operate on the platform: Aadhaar, PAN, and either GST
                  or Udyam registration. Employees added by a shop may upload Aadhaar and PAN for
                  their own KYC record.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Addresses</strong> — the pickup and delivery addresses you save, including
                  district, taluk and PIN code, and a label such as Home or Work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Device details</strong> — the category, brand, series, model, variant,
                  colour and storage you select. During shop intake a staff member may scan or enter
                  the <strong>IMEI</strong> or a device QR code, note missing parts, and record the
                  device <strong>PIN or pattern</strong> where the repair cannot be tested without
                  unlocking the handset.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Photos</strong> — images of the device you upload when requesting a sell
                  quotation, and images a technician captures as before-and-after evidence of a
                  repair.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Voice notes</strong> — the optional audio recording you can make to
                  describe the complaint. It is stored against that single repair ticket.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Answers you give in a flow</strong> — screening answers about a handset you
                  are selling (working or dead, screen condition, functional faults, accessories and
                  warranty status), and your approval or rejection of a repair estimate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Chat messages</strong> — what you write to a shop, and what the shop writes
                  back, in the in-app chat.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Support requests</strong> — what you tell us when you call, message on
                  WhatsApp or email {BRAND.email}.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Service records</strong> — bookings, ticket status changes and their
                  timestamps, pickup events, quotations, invoices and receipts generated as the work
                  moves through its stages.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Basic technical data</strong> — app version, platform and device type, plus

              <h3>The shop you choose</h3>
              <p>
                {BRAND.name} is multi-tenant: each shop can see its own customers and its own tickets,
                and not another shop’s. When you book a repair or accept a quotation, the shop you
                selected receives what it needs to do the job — your name, mobile number, the pickup
                or delivery address, the device and its IMEI where recorded, your description of the
                fault including any photos or voice note, the unlock PIN or pattern if you provided
                one, and the chat thread and order history for that job.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you post a device for sale, nearby shops that can quote see the device details,
                your screening answers, the photos and your approximate area — so they can price it.
                Full contact and address details are shared with a shop once you accept its
                quotation.
              </p>
              <h3>Shop staff</h3>
              <p>
                Inside a shop, the owner and the technician assigned to your ticket can see the job.
                A pickup agent sees the pickup address and contact number for the collection they are
                assigned to.
              </p>
              <h3>Service providers</h3>
              <p>
                We use a small number of vendors to run the platform: cloud hosting and managed
                database services, an image and media hosting service for device photos and voice
                notes, an email delivery provider for one-time passcodes and notices, an SMS or push
                notification provider, and an IMEI lookup service used to identify a handset from its
                IMEI at intake. They process data on our instructions and only for those purposes.
              </p>
              <h3>Legal</h3>
              <p>
                We may disclose information where the law requires it, to respond to a valid request
                from a public authority, or to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim — for
                example a dispute over a device.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>We do not sell your personal information</strong>, and we do not share it
                with advertising networks or data brokers.

              <p>
                The customer app asks for location permission for two reasons, and states them in
                exactly these words: we use your location to show pickup-enabled repair shops nearby
                and to set your default delivery address.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Shop discovery lists shops within roughly a <strong>20 km radius</strong> of the
                  point you are at, so you are not offered a shop that cannot collect from you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Address entry uses your coordinates to pre-fill a new address so you do not have to
                  type it out. You can always edit or replace it.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Location is requested at the moment a screen needs it. The customer app does not
                track your location in the background, and it does not build a movement history. If
                you decline the permission you can still use {BRAND.name} — you will need to search
                or enter an address manually instead. You can withdraw the permission at any time in
                your phone’s system settings.
              </p>

                Camera and microphone access are requested only when you tap the control that uses
                them — adding a photo of a device, scanning an IMEI or QR code at shop intake, or
                recording a voice note about a fault. Nothing is captured before you press the
                button, and nothing is captured while the app is in the background.
              </p>
              <p>
                Photos and voice notes are uploaded to our media hosting provider and attached to the
                specific quotation or repair ticket they belong to. They are visible to you and to
                the shop handling that job, and to {BRAND.company} support staff only where needed to
                investigate a problem you have raised. IMEI numbers scanned at intake may be sent to
                an IMEI lookup service purely to identify the make and model of the handset.

                All three {BRAND.name} apps offer an <strong>App Lock</strong> that can be secured

                A device unlock <strong>PIN or pattern that you give a shop</strong> is different —
                that is information you deliberately hand over so a technician can test the repair.
                It is stored on the repair ticket and visible to the shop working on your device.
                Give it only when the repair requires it, and change it once your device is returned.

                abuse.

                Once signed in, your app holds a session token so you stay signed in rather than

              <p>
                This section applies only to people employed by a shop that uses {BRAND.name}, not to
                customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shop employees clock in and out through the employee app. Because attendance is
                geofenced, the app records the coordinates and the distance from the shop at the
                exact moment of a check-in or check-out punch, together with the time. This is used
                to confirm the punch was made at the shop, to compute attendance, late hours, leave,
                permissions and salary reports, and to record pickup milestones such as reaching the
                customer’s location or arriving back at the shop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Only the punch events are recorded — the app does not follow an employee’s movements
                between punches. This data is visible to the employing shop owner and to the employee
                concerned. Employees with questions about how their shop uses attendance data should
                raise them with their employer in the first instance; we will assist where we can.
