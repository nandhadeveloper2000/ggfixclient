/**
 * /nearby-shops — the public "Near Shops" page.
 *
 * Route naming: this is deliberately NOT /shops. The singular /shop is already
 * the shop-owner B2B landing page, and /shop vs /shops would be a permanent
 * source of confusion for visitors and maintainers alike.
 *
 * This file is a server component: metadata, static copy and layout only. Every
 * byte of live data is fetched client-side in <NearbyShops />, because
 * next.config.js sets `output: 'export'` in production — there is no server at
 * request time, so no SSR fetching, no route handlers and no server actions.
